get_playlist_and_make_tar.py is a simple utility to make a tarfile out of an existing playlist from your iTunes Library.

sample usage:  python get_playlist_and_make_tar.py playlistname tarfilename
	where playlistname is the name of a playlist exactly as it appears from within your iTunes Library 
	and tarfilename will be the name the tar is saved as.  if no tarfilename is given, the program will use the playlistname as the default name.
	
After successfully running the above sample, the file tarfilename.tar will be in the folder where get_playlist_and_make_tar.py exists.

This utility was made in an hour to help solve a common use case I have so it is definitely not terribly robust and there is quite a lot of improvements and additions that could be made.
